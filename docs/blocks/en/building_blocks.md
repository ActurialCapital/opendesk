# Building Blocks

## Definition

The annualized long-term return of stock markets can be decomposed into three fundamental elements:

* **Income**: Empirically, dividend yield represents over half of the nominal market return and 70% of its real return. This suggests that investors should pay particular attention to companies that pay regular and reliable dividends.
* **Growth**: Earnings growth per share is another important source of stock returns. This growth can be influenced by factors such as innovation, economies of scale, and operational improvements. However, it is important to note that inflation can also play a significant role in earnings growth. Therefore, financial analysts must take into account the impact of inflation on earnings growth projections.
* **Valuation**: Finally, stock valuation, which refers to the price of stocks relative to earnings or cash flows, is a key factor in capital appreciation. Investors must be aware that high valuations can be a source of risk for stocks, as a correction downward can lead to significant losses. Therefore, it is important to closely monitor stock valuation levels before making an investment decision.

The building block methodology reflects a total stock return approach - taking into account both income and capital appreciation (i.e., price change over time). Therefore, our forecast building blocks consist of estimates for return (as an income factor) as well as earnings and sales growth and valuation change (as capital appreciation factors).

It is a valuable tool for financial analysts as it allows them to analyze the different sources of stock returns and evaluate their relative contribution to overall market performance. By using this type of method, analysts can better understand long-term trends in stock market returns and provide more accurate forecasts for investors.
