# Cost of Capital

## Definition

!!! info
    The cost of capital introduces the concept of risk and return, according to which riskier investments should have a higher expected return than safer investments. In this regard, expected returns can be written as $r_n = k_d + k_e$, where $k_d$ is the cost of debt, or the risk-free rate (the nominal return on bonds), and $k_e$ is the cost of equity, or Equity Risk Premium (ERP), an additional return for the risk of holding stocks.

The Equity Risk Premium (ERP) is the price of risk on the stock markets, and it is a key element in estimating the costs of equity and capital both in corporate finance and in valuation. Since portfolio construction relies on balancing risk and return, understanding the value of ERP remains crucial.

## Methods

We highlight four different concepts to calculate the Equity Risk Premium:

### Historical Equity Risk Premium
What stocks have returned in excess of bonds in the past.

### Required Equity Risk Premium
The extra return on bonds that investors demand to invest more in stocks (often determined by surveys of investors and managers).

### Expected Equity Risk Premium
What stocks are expected to return in excess of bonds (this is a forecast of stock returns, which can therefore increase during periods of bubbles).

### Implied Equity Risk Premium
The excess return over bonds implied in the current market price, which must be estimated (e.g. growth assumptions). We focus on this latter concept in our internal research. Thus, there are different techniques that could be used:

* **Dividend-based approach**:
    * Evaluate dividends and share buybacks
    * Calculate a discount rate
* **Earnings-based approach**:
    * Base the valuation on earnings instead of dividends
    * Earnings aggregate both income and growth
    * Compensate for low or non-existent dividend payouts
* **Residual approach**:
    * Companies' ability to earn more than is necessary to reinvest and grow the business
* **Others**:
    * Cross-sectional regression
    * Default risk
