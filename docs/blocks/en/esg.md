# ESG

Factor investing is an investment strategy that seeks to identify and invest in specific factors that explain the returns of financial assets such as stocks and bonds. This approach involves a systematic analysis of various factors, including economic indicators, market trends, and other measurable variables, to determine which factors are most likely to generate the highest returns. By focusing on these factors, investors can potentially achieve superior risk-adjusted returns compared to traditional investment approaches.

!!! example 
    An example of factor investing is the use of the volatility factor. Investors seeking to exploit this factor may construct a portfolio that invests in stocks that tend to be less volatile than the overall market, which can result in a volatility premium. Investors can also use other factors such as valuation, company size, earnings quality, and liquidity to construct portfolios that have increased exposure to these factors. The goal is to achieve a superior long-term return compared to the benchmark index. In this way, factor investing involves a systematic approach to selecting and combining various factors that are expected to generate higher risk-adjusted returns than traditional investment strategies.

In this context, the effort undertaken here is focused on the risk premium that ESG factors can potentially offer. Specifically, the aim is to identify and analyze the factors that are most likely to generate superior returns over the long term, taking into account their ESG characteristics. By systematically evaluating the ESG factors that are most relevant to financial performance, investors can potentially construct portfolios that offer both strong returns and positive environmental, social, and governance outcomes. Ultimately, the goal is to achieve a more sustainable and responsible approach to investing that benefits both investors and society as a whole.

For the sake of transparency, here are some definitions:

* **Risk premium**: The risk premium is the additional compensation that an investor demands for taking on additional risk. It is often used to measure the expected return of an investment, based on its level of risk
* **Alpha**: In finance, alpha is a measure of an investment's risk-adjusted performance relative to a benchmark index such as the overall market. Alpha is crucial because it helps:
  * Evaluate a portfolio manager's ability to generate returns that are superior to those of the market under similar risk conditions
  * Identify the sources of an investment's returns. If an investment consistently generates a positive alpha, it may indicate that the portfolio manager is able to select securities that offer added value compared to the overall market or to exploit inefficiencies in the market.

We believe there are two categories of innovation in factor investing and the consideration of risks related to climate transition and their impact on factors:

1. The first is based on the **creation of factors**: These factors must be differentiating (after all, market finance is a zero-sum game) and statistically viable.
2. The second is based on **financial engineering**: The portfolio construction phase. Studies conducted on the residual (the portion that cannot be explained by the model) show that it behaves purely randomly. Therefore, in theory, it is pointless to focus on discovering other factors.

## Innovation in the Industrie

Risk factors can help investors understand market developments and construct high-performing portfolios. These factors can generate a added returns due to a distinct risk premium and are known to provide high risk-adjusted returns over a long period of time.


!!! info "Rewarded Factors"
    When the market experiences poor performance, investors tend to become more risk-averse and demand higher returns to compensate for the additional risk they are taking. This increased demand for returns in times of crisis leads to an increase in the prices of assets that offer exposure to these factors, resulting in higher long-term returns. These factors offer a premium because they tend to perform well when investors need it the most.

Academic research publication on market anomalies can have a significant impact on the profitability of these strategies. In previous research, it has been shown that published strategy returns can decrease by up to 26% out of sample and up to 58% in the five years following publication (Novy-Marx, 2013, Meilhoc Ricaume, ActurialCapital, 2023). However, even after five years, a non-negligible proportion of anomaly profitability is still preserved, and it can still be used profitably in a diversified portfolio.

After significant loss experienced by traditional equity factors in 2019 and 2020, the industry has proposed a range of new factors such as sustainability, innovation, machine learning (ML) related or not to ESG, which have shown better performance than recent historical backtests in terms of returns. However, we can address the issues of "factor zoo" and "p-hacking" through various examples, especially in ESG.

The term "factor zoo" is often used to describe the large number of investment factors that have been proposed in financial literature. The problem with the "factor zoo" is that some factors may be the result of random data or selection bias. It can be difficult for investors to determine which factors are truly important for generating long-term superior returns and which are mere coincidental.

We present a method to streamline and identify viable ESG factors. These factors should possess the following characteristics:

* **Persuasive** : Demonstrated long-term evidence across different geographies and asset categories
* **Robuste** : Adjusted for costs and known factors, even after publication
* **Plausible** : Supported by evidence of an underlying economic mechanism.

## Transition Risk

!!! tips "Transition Risks Information"
    Transition risks move prices. This statement that is supported by two major criteria:
    1. Evidence based on academic and professional research, including scientific literature, earnings calls, roadshows by financial analysts, discussions regarding these risks, and factual observations such as initiatives taken by asset managers and institutional investors
    2. Evidence based on market returns, where the statistical analysis of returns from various markets such as derivatives, stocks, and bonds, as well as key events such as climate events, presidential elections (Trump vs. Biden), and policy changes related to climate change, can explain these returns.

Understanding transition risks associated with climate change is crucial for investors seeking to achieve their financial and non-financial objectives. The transition to a low-carbon economy may require significant political, legal, technological, and market changes. Depending on the nature, speed, and direction of these changes, transition risks may pose a financial risk for organizations. Therefore, this risk has become a major concern for institutional investors.

We explore market-based measures of transition risk and their use in constructing multi-factor portfolios for investors. A key challenge for portfolio construction is integrating these objectives in terms of exposure to style factors. 

> Felix Goltz, PhD, Scientific Beta, stated that "Climate transition risk might be embedded in equity style factors."

!!! info "Styles"
    Style factors are portfolio characteristics used to identify stocks with similar risk and return profiles. They are often used in quantitative analysis to help build diversified portfolios and reduce overall risk. The most common style factors include value, growth, size, liquidity, and volatility.

## Discretionnary Views

Empirical studies on this topic have mixed results: Carbon emissions data are backward-looking, and there is a risk asymmetry where risks depend on many factors such as management quality, technological progress, innovation capacity, competition, demand structure, and financial health. In some cases, carbon consumption is a necessary investment for environmental technological advancement. The price elasticity of demand differs among companies, and substitution technologies may have different costs for different companies. For example, a taxi company may not face the same constraints as an airline company when changing its fleet.

## Quantitative Views

An alternative method of measuring an asset's exposure to climate transition risk is by examining the variability of its returns, which reflects the information used by market participants. Empirical evidence suggests that market participants, including analysts and institutional investors, take climate transition risks into account, which in turn influences asset prices, such as stock returns, option prices, and bond prices. The prices of carbon, regulations, technological changes, and consumer preferences also affect a company's cash flows.

To estimate an asset's exposure to transition risk, we use sector-specific data from the Climate Policy Relevant Sectors (CPRS) to construct market-neutral beta factors. This method helps control for market exposure and allows for the identification of assets with varying levels of sensitivity to transition risk using a "transition beta" obtained through regression.

This approach allows for controlling the exposure to the market factor, thereby identifying the stocks that are sensitive to its variation. These estimates can help better evaluate the risk associated with assets and make informed investment decisions. 

## Integration

By integrating the "transition beta" with style factors, which present differing exposures to transition risk, we suggest that these factors can help mitigate the impact of climate transition risk on portfolios.

 The "transition beta" provides an explicit, simple, and transparent tool for highlighting implicit and complex financial and non-financial risks.
