# Arbitrage and Publications

The objective of this research is to analyze the post-publication performance of investment strategies, focusing on the extent to which market anomalies can be exploited and whether profits decline once it gains widespread attention. Additionally, we explore the possibility of synchronization between different investment strategies.

In economics and finance, the analysis of market anomalies aims to identify profitable trading strategies based on market inefficiencies. However, the exploitation of these anomalies is confined by arbitrage limits, which originate from the risks and expenses associated with carrying out these trades. Our investigation delves into the concept of arbitrage limits as they relate to market anomalies and the impact of human psychology. These are frequently discussed matters of interest.

## Arbitrage Limits

In financial markets, arbitrage is a strategy aimed at taking advantage of observed price divergences between two markets or similar financial instruments in order to make a profit. This technique relies on the assumption that the prices of similar assets should be identical or very close, given market conditions and associated risk factors. In the context of market efficiency, which assumes that asset prices reflect all available information, arbitrage opportunities are therefore limited.

!!! example "Arbitrage 101"
    For example, arbitrage is a financial strategy that involves exploiting price discrepancies observed between financial markets to generate profits without taking significant risks. When an asset is traded at a lower price on two different markets, an arbitrageur can buy this asset on the market where it is undervalued and immediately sell it on the market where it is overvalued, thus realizing a net profit. This strategy relies on the assumption that markets are not perfectly efficient and that it is possible to identify short-term arbitrage opportunities. However, competition among arbitrageurs usually limits the duration of these opportunities and leads to a reduction in the observed price gap between the relevant markets.

This practice requires a thorough analysis and understanding of the different markets, the financial instruments traded therein, distortions caused by unforeseen events, or irrational investor behavior. These strategies are based on systematic models theories.

The classical definition of arbitrage implies a risk-free exchange that requires no capital investment. However, in practice, any arbitrage activity involves some degree of risk and capital investment:

* Price discrepancies may correct more slowly or more quickly than expected
* Unforeseen events may change market conditions
* Regulatory constraints on the use of leverage, making it difficult to fully exploit market inefficiencies

Moreover, market anomalies exhibit returns that vary over time, and a significant portion of returns may be preserved due to the risks associated with arbitrage. This suggests that the efficiency of arbitrage (in the sense that the price of an asset reflects its fundamental value) remains limited, especially in extreme market conditions.

An example of an arbitrage limit is the "dispersion of risk premiums," which refers to the variation in security returns within a given market. This dispersion creates arbitrage opportunities for investors, but these opportunities are limited by transaction costs, counterparty risks, and leverage constraints. Frazzini and Pedersen (2014) show that hedge funds have suboptimal positions due to leverage constraints and transaction costs and thus cannot fully exploit arbitrage opportunities.

## Returns et Publications

 Academic research on market anomalies can have a significant impact on the profitability of these strategies. When researchers publish academic studies on market anomalies, it can affect the profitability of strategies. Although similar strategy funds may experience a decrease in profitability after disclosure, it is important to note that returns do not immediately decrease. In fact, a significant proportion of profitability is still present. Studies have shown that returns of published strategies may decrease up to 26% out of sample and up to 58% during the five years following publication (Novy-Marx, 2013). However, even after five years, a non-negligible proportion of the anomaly-related profitability is still preserved and can still be used profitably in a diversified portfolio as a risk factor (smart beta).

## Factor Timing

Est-il possible de compenser la détérioration des performances en choisissant correctement le moment d'exécuter des stratégies ou des anomalies? La littérature reconnaît diverses approches pour planifier le moment d'exécution des stratégies d'anomalies:

Is it possible to offset the deterioration in performance by timing the execution of strategies or anomalies correctly? The literature recognizes various approaches to timing anomaly detections strategies:

* Huang and Huang, in their study titled "Real-Time Profitability of Published Anomalies: An Out-of-Sample Test," consider a long-only strategy with a universe of published anomalies and recursively choose the best performance during a given training period each year. According to this study, the strategy can outperform the stock market even in the presence of transaction costs. The results suggest that anomalies can persist even after controlling for optimization bias.
* Basu and Hung, in their study titled "Anomaly Timing," constructed arbitrage portfolios based on historical market returns. These portfolios have a similar or higher Sharpe ratio even with transaction costs and lower volatility. Such portfolios have significant alphas even for factor models that can explain portfolio returns.
* Yang, in his study titled "Decomposing Factor Momentum," shows us that the profitability of the momentum factor, when periodically readjusted, is empirically superior to factor timing.

## Conclusion

Based on academic literature, arbitrage strategies have limitations due to factors such as transaction costs, market uncertainty, limited capital capacity, and associated risks (Fama, 1998; Lakonishok et al., 1994). In addition, the publication of research results can lead to a decrease in profits due to increased competition and imitation of strategies (Chan and Lakonishok, 1993).

However, some researchers have proposed ways to mitigate these negative effects. For example, Hirshleifer and Shumway (2003) suggested that investors could anticipate the publication of research results by being alert to research publications, thus allowing for early adoption of ideas before official publication. This strategy has been successfully adopted by some investors (Fung and Hsieh, 2000).

Another approach is to rotate possible arbitrages for a given asset class (Asness et al., 2013). It is also advisable to diversify portfolios by including a set of arbitrages rather than focusing on a single unique strategy (Frazzini and Pedersen, 2014).

Finally, it is important to note that investors must adapt research ideas to their own investment context, taking into account their risk tolerance, investment universe, and portfolio composition (Ang et al., 2010). Investors can also combine research ideas with other strategies to reduce the concentration of a single strategy (Asness et al., 2013).
