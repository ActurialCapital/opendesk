# Terms

## Private Licence

ActurialCapital - Opendesk (opendesk) is hosted in a private repository on GitHub. The access to the repository is licensed and granted by invitation only on a paid basis. The users pay for the continued access to the repository, including updates, support, and maintenance.

If your license expires, your software or system will not break down and will keep working fine with your most recent version by that time. However, if you discontinue your paid license you will lose any updates and (critical) bugfixes that will follow.

## Important note

It is illegal to vendor, publish, distribute, or commercialize the opendesk source code without a separate permission. Violation of the licensing terms will trigger a ban followed by a legal pursuit.

Any licensed user, developer, team, or company, having obtained paid access to the opendesk repository from us, can use opendesk as a dependency, subject to the terms and limitations of the paid subscription plans.

Licensees can use, copy, and modify opendesk as long as they do not vendor, publish, distribute, or commercialize the source code of opendesk.

It is allowed to specify opendesk as a dependency of your software as long as you do not include a copy of the opendesk source code in your software.

If you are a software developer you should specify opendesk as your requirement. The end-user of your software is responsible for obtaining his own individual PRO license. The best practice is to make it clear in your docs or on your website.
